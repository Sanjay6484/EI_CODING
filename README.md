##1. Design Patterns
   
##i) Behavioral Design Patterns

Use Case: Observer Pattern 
*Scenario: Live Cricket Match Commentary System
*Description:
Implement a live cricket match commentary system where multiple clients (observers) subscribe to updates on match commentaries. Whenever the commentary updates, the system notifies all subscribed clients.

Use Case: Visitor Pattern
*Scenario: Online Shopping Cart Pricing
*Description:
Implement a system where different items (books, fruits) in a shopping cart are visited by a pricing visitor to calculate the total cost. This allows the pricing logic to be easily extended for new item types without modifying existing item classes.

##ii) Creational Pattern
Use Case: Factory Pattern
*Scenario: Cricket Academy Player Creation
*Description:
Create a system where different types of cricket players (Batsman, Bowler, AllRounder) are created using factory classes, allowing easy extension without modifying existing creation logic.

Use Case: Singleton Pattern
*Scenario: Food Delivery System 
*Description:
Create a system where a single instance of the order management system manages food delivery orders, ensuring centralized control and preventing multiple instances.


##iii) Structural Pattern
Use Case: Adapter Pattern
*Scenario: Database Connection Adapter
*Description:
Create a system where a new application needs to interact with different types of databases (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB). Each database has its own connection and query interface, but the application expects a uniform interface to interact with these databases.

Use Case: Decorator Pattern
*Scenario: Coffee Shop Beverage Customization
*Description:
Create a system where different types of coffee drinks can be customized with various add-ons (like Milk, Sugar, Whipped Cream) using decorators. This allows for dynamically adding new features to the coffee without altering the existing code structure.
